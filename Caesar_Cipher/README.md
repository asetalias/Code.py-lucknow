# Caesar Cipher

## Description
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and widely known encryption technique. It operates by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions.

## Rules
To create a Caesar Cipher program, you need to:
1. Define the alphabet (e.g., A-Z).
2. Specify the shift value for encryption or decryption.
3. Implement the logic to shift each letter by the specified value, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.
4. Provide options for the user to encrypt or decrypt a message using the chosen shift value.

## Usage
To use the Caesar Cipher, you can either encrypt or decrypt a message by specifying the shift value.
