# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The game allows players to play against a computer dealer.

## How to Play
1. The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
2. The player can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (stop receiving cards).
3. The dealer then reveals their face-down card and hits until their hand is worth 17 or more.
4. The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without going over 21.

## Installation
To play the game, simply download the files and run the main script.
