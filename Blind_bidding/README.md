# Blind Bidding

## Introduction
Blind bidding is a method used in auctions where bidders submit sealed bids without knowing the bids of other participants. This approach is often used to prevent bias and collusion among bidders.

## Usage
To use the blind bidding system, follow these steps:
1. Open the blind_bidding application.
2. Enter the item you want to bid on.
3. Submit your bid without knowing the bids of other participants.
4. The highest bidder wins the item.
